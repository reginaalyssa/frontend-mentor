## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this article preview component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The only JavaScript you'll need for this challenge is to initiate the share options when someone clicks the share icon.

Users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon
